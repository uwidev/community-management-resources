As they are staff members, they are expected to uphold staff responsibilities.\n\n## Responsibilities\nModerators ensures that [Members](Members) of the server adhere to its rules and philosophies. Those who take action against the rules/philosophies face disciplinary action from moderators in the form of warns, mutes, kicks, and bans.\n\n## Disciplinary Action\nModerators should actually *discipline* the offenders. So not only is handing the punishment a responsibility, but also teaching offenders how not to repeat said offense. \n\nTo do discipline, the offending member needs to know the following.\n1. The rule that was broken.\n2. An elaboration of the rule, such that the offender fully understands.\n3. The rule-breaking action, and how it broke the rule.\n\nThrough sufficient disciplining, offending members can no longer argue that they \"didn't know,\" and it can be easier to differentiate between those who actually want to support the community and those who are just here for the ride.\n\n### Order Matters\nThe order in which you present information when disciplining **does** matter. \n\nStarting with their rule-breaking action is usually seen as an attack, that \"you did wrong, therefore you are bad\". Instead, you should start by finding common ground with the rules, and potentially let the user come to terms and realize that maybe they went too far.\n\nWe want to create understanding, not an argument. The moment this turns into an argument, it's learning becomes about who is right, not what is right.\n\nThis is not a hard rule, but a suggestion.","lastmodified":"2022-07-08T00:13:01.302150272Z","tags":null},"/definitions/Staff-Members":{"title":"Staff Members","content":"**Staff Members (Staff)** are members of management.\n\n## Responsibilities\nStaff are the face of the server; they act as role models and uphold the server's rules and philosophies. If they don't, many social problems can result. See [Repercussions of Non-abiding Staff](discussions/Repercussions%20of%20Non-abiding%20Staff.md).\n\nStaff members also stand along-side [[Regulars]]. Together, these two make up the majority-tone of the server.","lastmodified":"2022-07-08T00:13:01.302150272Z","tags":null},"/discussions/Classification-of-Rule-Breaking":{"title":"Classifications of Rule Breaking","content":"When rules are broken, there appears to be three classifications, with one special case. These rules will be ordered based on increasing severity, assuming the same rule is broken.\n\n## Ignorance\nSometimes, members \"read\" the rules. Other times, they read the rules, but it didn't register into their memory. In either case, said member has no rule to base their actions on.\n\nThis is similar to meeting someone knew, hearing their name, and not being able to recall their name; not because you forgot, but because it never registered.\n\n## Misunderstandings\nMembers can read rules and digest it in ways not intended. This is very common when catch-all rules are used, as they can be vague and can be open up for interpretation; misunderstandings are common.\n\nAn easy example of this is \"No NSFW\". What kind of content is too NSFW to be allowed? The answer varies depending on the person and context.\n\n## Impulsive, Reckless, Inconsiderate\nMembers can read the rules, completely understand it, but act without enough thought. These cases are quite common, since emotions, behavior, and habits drive these cases.\n\nArguments, especially heated ones, are the prime example of this kind of rule breaking. Shitposting in the middle of a conversation or randomly dropping irrelevant media content in a channel is also quite common.\n\n## Special case: Broken deliberately\nOn rare occasions, members might feel a bit daring, spiteful, for trolly. These members fully know they are breaking a rule, and break it. Severity depends on if it is justified, but most of the time, to deliberately break a rule without discussing to staff about it is punishable. \n\nMost cases have little to no emotional drive, and instead, have ample thought to their actions.\n\nPosting images after explicitly being told not to post images is an example of this.","lastmodified":"2022-07-08T00:13:01.302150272Z","tags":null},"/discussions/Repercussions-of-Non-abiding-Staff":{"title":"Repercussions of Non-abiding Staff","content":"[Staff Members](definitions/Staff%20Members.md) that don't abide to the server's rules and philosophies create confusion among [[Members]]. Members will think that an action is okay, when in fact it is not. \n\nThis becomes even more problematic when punishment is enforced unequally. The frustration this creates for regular members is immense, and the only \"relief\" is to punish said staffâ€”and that's just the start of the cascading problems.\n- Members have now learned that staff does not apply their rules equally, trust is lost.\n\t- Whether it was due to oversight or intentional does not matter. The emotional experience of frustration and context override rightful recourse.\n- Members will specifically spite that staff member.\n- Staff members now have to deal with the awkwardness of disciplining past behavior.\n\nThat said, it's critical that staff abide to the server's rules and philosophies.\n\n## References\n[Staff Members](definitions/Staff%20Members.md)","lastmodified":"2022-07-08T00:13:01.302150272Z","tags":null},"/discussions/Transparency-on-Bans":{"title":"Transparency on Bans","content":"## Scenario\nFor this discussion, we will assume an obedient member, Bob.\n\nBob really likes the server, but he's dealing with personal drama that's really getting to him. He comes to the server to try to relax, but is in a rather bitter mood, and this bitterness is evident his behavior. Bob is seen as annoying and aggressive.\n\nThis is a repeated pattern of Bob for the past few days, with each case resulting in a mute. He has been [Disciplinary Action](definitions/Community%20Moderator.md#Disciplinary%20Action) multiple times, but still quite figure things out.\n\nAt this point, he has reason for a potential ban. The problem: when do you ban? Even bigger problem: how do members know how bans work?\n\n## Discussion\nThe most frustrating and sad thing for a member who genuinely enjoys their time with a community is to be banned from it without any prior warning. There is argument that of course Bob should have known a ban was possible, but the problem is that he will never really know unless there's a concrete agreement from the start.\n\nThis puts further emphasis on forcing users to think before they act. And while acting based on a fear of ban isn't the best motivation, it wouldn't have got to this point if they had thought beforehand. They will learn one way or another.\n\nOn creating that concrete agreement, the most straight-forward implementation of it is a 3-Strike System, though a [4-Strike System](definitions/4-Strike%20System.md) might be better.","lastmodified":"2022-07-08T00:13:01.302150272Z","tags":null}}
