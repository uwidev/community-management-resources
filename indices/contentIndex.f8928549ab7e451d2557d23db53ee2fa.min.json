These rules will be ordered based on severity, assuming the same rule is broken.\n\n## (1) Ignorance\nSometimes, members \"read\" the rules. Other times, they read the rules, but it didn't register into their memory. In either case, said member has no rule to base their actions on.\n\nThis is similar to meeting someone knew, hearing their name, and not being able to recall their name; not because you forgot, but because it never registered.\n\n## (2) Misunderstandings\nMembers can read rules and digest it in ways not intended. This is very common when catch-all rules are used, as they can be vague and can be open up for interpretation; misunderstandings are common.\n\nAn easy example of this is \"No NSFW\". What kind of content is too NSFW to be allowed? The answer varies depending on the person and context.\n\n## (3) Impulsive, Reckless, Inconsiderate\nMembers can read the rules, completely understand it, but act without enough thought. These cases are quite common, since emotions, behavior, and habits drive these cases.\n\nArguments, especially heated ones, are the prime example of this kind of rule breaking. Shitposting in the middle of a conversation or randomly dropping irrelevant media content in a channel is also quite common.\n\n## (4) Special case: Broken deliberately\nOn rare occasions, members might feel a bit daring, spiteful, for trolly. These members fully know they are breaking a rule, and break it. Severity depends on if it is justified, but most of the time, to deliberately break a rule without discussing to staff about it is punishable. \n\nMost cases have little to no emotional drive, and instead, have ample thought to their actions.\n\nPosting images after explicitly being told not to post images","lastmodified":"2022-06-29T17:30:36.859432413Z","tags":null}}
