Most resources are tailored specifically to Discord.\n\n**Todo**\n- [ ] What is considered spam\n- [ ] roles of moderators? janitors? community managers? what responsibilities are there, and to what role should it belong to?\n\t- [ ] [[Community Moderator]]\n\n# Assorted Notes\n[Classification of Rule Breaking](definitions/Classification%20of%20Rule%20Breaking.md)\n[Staff Members](definitions/Staff%20Members.md)\n[Repercussions of Non-abiding Staff](definitions/Repercussions%20of%20Non-abiding%20Staff.md)\n[Community Moderator](definitions/Community%20Moderator.md)","lastmodified":"2022-07-03T02:56:36.047842753Z","tags":null},"/definitions/Classification-of-Rule-Breaking":{"title":"Classifications of Rule Breaking","content":"When rules are broken, there appears to be three classifications, with one special case. These rules will be ordered based on increasing severity, assuming the same rule is broken.\n\n## (1) Ignorance\nSometimes, members \"read\" the rules. Other times, they read the rules, but it didn't register into their memory. In either case, said member has no rule to base their actions on.\n\nThis is similar to meeting someone knew, hearing their name, and not being able to recall their name; not because you forgot, but because it never registered.\n\n## (2) Misunderstandings\nMembers can read rules and digest it in ways not intended. This is very common when catch-all rules are used, as they can be vague and can be open up for interpretation; misunderstandings are common.\n\nAn easy example of this is \"No NSFW\". What kind of content is too NSFW to be allowed? The answer varies depending on the person and context.\n\n## (3) Impulsive, Reckless, Inconsiderate\nMembers can read the rules, completely understand it, but act without enough thought. These cases are quite common, since emotions, behavior, and habits drive these cases.\n\nArguments, especially heated ones, are the prime example of this kind of rule breaking. Shitposting in the middle of a conversation or randomly dropping irrelevant media content in a channel is also quite common.\n\n## (4) Special case: Broken deliberately\nOn rare occasions, members might feel a bit daring, spiteful, for trolly. These members fully know they are breaking a rule, and break it. Severity depends on if it is justified, but most of the time, to deliberately break a rule without discussing to staff about it is punishable. \n\nMost cases have little to no emotional drive, and instead, have ample thought to their actions.\n\nPosting images after explicitly being told not to post images is an example of this.","lastmodified":"2022-07-03T02:56:36.047842753Z","tags":null},"/definitions/Community-Moderator":{"title":"Community Moderator","content":"A **Community Moderator (Moderator)** is a member of [Staff Members](definitions/Staff%20Members.md) who disciplines members who break rules or philosophies. As they are staff members, they are expected to uphold staff responsibilities.\n\n## Responsibilities\nModerators ensures that [Members](Members) of the server adhere to its rules and philosophies. Those who take action against them face disciplinary action from moderators in the form of warns, mutes, kicks, and bans.\n\n### Disciplinary Action\nDisciplinary action is important, as in, moderators should actually *discipline* the offenders. So not only is handing the punishment a responsibility, but also teaching offenders how not to repeat said offense. To do this, the offending member needs to know the following.\n1. The rule that was broken.\n2. An elaboration of the rule, such that the offender fully understands.\n3. The rule-breaking action, and how it broke the rule.\n\n#### Order Matters\nThe order in which you present this **does** matter. \n\nStarting with their rule-breaking action is usually seen as an attack, that \"you did wrong, therefore you are bad\". Instead, you should start by finding common ground with the rules, and potentially let the user come to terms and realize that maybe they went too far.\n\nWe want to create understanding, not an argument. The moment this turns into an argument, it's learning becomes about who is right, not what is right.","lastmodified":"2022-07-03T02:56:36.047842753Z","tags":null},"/definitions/Repercussions-of-Non-abiding-Staff":{"title":"Repercussions of Non-abiding Staff","content":"[Staff Members](definitions/Staff%20Members.md) that don't abide to the server's rules and philosophies create confusion among [[Members]]. Members will think that an action is okay, when in fact it is not. \n\nThis becomes even more problematic when punishment is enforced unequally. The frustration this creates is immense, and the only \"relief\" is to punish said staff, but the cascading problems created are catastrophic.\n- Members have now learned that staff does not apply their rules equally, trust is lost.\n\t- Whether it was due to oversight or intentional does not matter. The emotional experience of frustration and context override rightful recourse.\n- Members will specifically spite that staff member.\n- Staff members now have to deal with the awkwardness of disciplining past behavior.\n\nThat said, it's critical that staff abide to the server's rules and philosophies.\n\n## References\n[Staff Members](definitions/Staff%20Members.md)","lastmodified":"2022-07-03T02:56:36.047842753Z","tags":null},"/definitions/Staff-Members":{"title":"Staff Members","content":"**Staff Members (Staff)** are members of management.\n\n## Responsibilities\nStaff are the face of the server; they act as role models and uphold the server's rules and philosophies.
