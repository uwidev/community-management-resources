As they are staff members, they are expected to uphold staff responsibilities.\n\n## Responsibilities\nModerators ensures that [Members](Members) of the server adhere to its rules and philosophies. Those who take action against the rules/philosophies face disciplinary action from moderators in the form of warns, mutes, kicks, and bans.\n\n## Disciplinary Action\nModerators should actually *discipline* the offenders. So not only is handing the punishment a responsibility, but also teaching offenders how not to repeat said offense. \n\nTo do discipline, the offending member needs to know the following.\n1. The rule that was broken.\n2. An elaboration of the rule, such that the offender fully understands.\n3. The rule-breaking action, and how it broke the rule.\n\nThrough sufficient disciplining, offending members can no longer argue that they \"didn't know,\" and it can be easier to differentiate between those who actually want to support the community and those who are just here for the ride.\n\n### Order Matters\nThe order in which you present information when disciplining **does** matter. \n\nStarting with their rule-breaking action is usually seen as an attack, that \"you did wrong, therefore you are bad\". Instead, you should start by finding common ground with the rules, and potentially let the user come to terms and realize that maybe they went too far.\n\nWe want to create understanding, not an argument. The moment this turns into an argument, it's learning becomes about who is right, not what is right.\n\nThis is not a hard rule, but a suggestion.","lastmodified":"2022-07-10T17:25:51.583921278Z","tags":null},"/definitions/Infamy-System":{"title":"Infamy System","content":"An **Infamy System** is a moderation system that aggregates an infamy value based on infraction cases to determine the case of a ban.\n\nFor a more relaxed take on determining bans, see [Strikes System](definitions/Strikes%20System.md). It loses the ability to determine severity of intraction. \n\n## Extending Infractions\n[Infractions](definitions/Infractions.md) now have some infamy value attached to them. How this value is determined is up to the community, but is usually weighted based on the severity of the infraction. *Severity* can include things like:\n- deliberateness of infraction\n- server damage/annoyance\n- duration of infraction instance\n- repetition\n\n## Users have Infamy\nUsers now have an infamy value, which is determined by the sum of all infamy from their infractions. Once this value reaches a certain point, the server is to be banned, or at the very least, highly considered for one.\n\n## Example of an Infamy System\n**(1-infamy infraction)** *Basic* cases of rule-breaking; simple corrections, and user listens to moderators. \n\n**(2-infamy infraction)** *Moderate* cases of rule-breaking; time-extended rule-break, and maybe some reluctance to listen and needed a mute.\n\n**(3-infamy infraction)** *Severe* cases of rule-breaking; spamming the server due to spite or an argument, reluctance to communicate or admit any wrong-doings, deliberate rule-breaking\n\nOnce a user reaches 5 or above infamy, they are given a final warning. Any further infractions will result in a ban.\n\nEdge case: Users at 4 infamy, and commit a severe rule-break may be banned on the spot.","lastmodified":"2022-07-10T17:25:51.583921278Z","tags":null},"/definitions/Infractions":{"title":"Infractions","content":"An **Infraction** is the official violation of a rule or community guidelines.\n\nInfractions are used on a some bigger system to determine grounds for issuing punishments on community members (mutes, kicks, bans).\n\nAs to what *official* means will vary from community to community, but generally, if there's some [Strikes System](definitions/Strikes%20System.md), then an infraction would be when a strike is written in their database of strikes on users.\n\nInfractions can also be *tagged* to characterize it, beyond the reason the infraction was placed.

There are two mechanics to this system: what counts as an infraction, and how many infractions result to the ban.\n\nFor a more nuanced take on determining bans, see [Infamy System](definitions/Infamy%20System.md). It extends infractions to have an infamy value, and bans based on a user's total infamy value.\n\n## Determining Infractions\nSee [Determining Infractions](discussions/Determining%20Infractions.md).\n\n## How Many Strikes\nOne may jump to a 3-strike system, similar to baseball, and that may work. Generally, you want enough strikes to give members some wiggle room to learn from their mistakes. A two strike lesson (ban on the second infraction) has only one instance of punishment and learning. And for learning, typically you need repeated exposure before things finally click.\n\n## Forgiveness\nYou don't un-strike in baseball, so a strikes system doesn't have anything built-in for forgiveness. Without it, it doesn't fully capture the human perception of \"badness\" over time.

These rules will be ordered based on increasing severity, assuming the same rule is broken.\n\n## Ignorance\nSometimes, members \"read\" the rules. Other times, they read the rules, but it didn't register into their memory. In either case, said member has no rule to base their actions on.\n\nThis is similar to meeting someone knew, hearing their name, and not being able to recall their name; not because you forgot, but because it never registered.\n\n## Misunderstandings\nMembers can read rules and digest it in ways not intended. This is very common when catch-all rules are used, as they can be vague and can be open up for interpretation; misunderstandings are common.\n\nAn easy example of this is \"No NSFW\". What kind of content is too NSFW to be allowed? The answer varies depending on the person and context.\n\n## Impulsive, Reckless, Inconsiderate\nMembers can read the rules, completely understand it, but act without enough thought. These cases are quite common, since emotions, behavior, and habits drive these cases.\n\nArguments, especially heated ones, are the prime example of this kind of rule breaking. Shitposting in the middle of a conversation or randomly dropping irrelevant media content in a channel is also quite common.\n\n## Special case: Broken deliberately\nOn rare occasions, members might feel a bit daring, spiteful, for trolly. These members fully know they are breaking a rule, and break it. Severity depends on if it is justified, but most of the time, to deliberately break a rule without discussing to staff about it is punishable. \n\nMost cases have little to no emotional drive, and instead, have ample thought to their actions.\n\nPosting images after explicitly being told not to post images is an example of this.","lastmodified":"2022-07-10T17:25:51.583921278Z","tags":null},"/discussions/Infraction-Forgiveness":{"title":"Infraction Forgiveness","content":"**Human error is unavoiable.** [Infractions](definitions/Infractions.md) should have some way for forgiveness.\n\nI think a lot of people can agree that all cases of wrong-doings can lie on some spectrum of forgiveness. When it comes to moderating an online community, there are infractions, and then there is forgiveness for said infractions.\n\nFor some communities, forgiveness is often overlooked and ignored. Infractions are forever. But this just isn't a good model for how humans perceive wrong-doing over time. \n\nIf someone were to accidentally give you a fork when you asked for a spoon (the infraction), but they corrected it and consistently gave you forks afterwards, you are not going to spite that person several weeks later.\n\nAnd there are obvious real cases where forgiveness isn't really possible (domestic violence), but the chances are not 0% given enough time.\n\n## Implementing Forgiveness\nHow forgiveness works will vary from community to community, specially based on how they judge [what counts as an infraction](discussions/Determining%20Infractions.md). But here are some things to consider when creating a forgiveness system. \n\n*Italicized bullets list forgiveness ratings from easily forgiven to hardly forgiven.*\n- make sure offending members knows that recovery for human error is possible\n- be consistent in forgiveness\n- be transparent when infractions are forgiven\n- forgivenss should be largely weighted on [Classification of Rule Breaking](discussions/Classification%20of%20Rule%20Breaking.md)\n\t- *ignorance, misunderstandings, impulse/reckless/inconsiderate, deliberate*\n- moderately weighted on the actual rule that was broken\n\t- *minor cases of posting content in the wrong channel, nsfw/ content in non-nsfw channel, raiding*\n- weighted on importance and quantity of affected members\n\t- *small amount/regular members, large amount/regulars/staff*\n- an infractions system with built-in forgiveness\n\t- e.g. ban after 3 infractions within 1 month, [[Infamy System]]","lastmodified":"2022-07-10T17:25:51.583921278Z","tags":null},"/discussions/Repercussions-of-Non-abiding-Staff":{"title":"Repercussions of Non-abiding Staff","content":"[Staff Members](definitions/Staff%20Members.md) that don't abide to the server's rules and philosophies create confusion among [[Members]].

He comes to the server to try to relax, but is in a rather bitter mood, and this bitterness is evident his behavior. Bob is seen as annoying and aggressive.\n\nThis is a repeated pattern of Bob for the past few days, with each case resulting in a mute. He has been [disciplined](definitions/Community%20Moderator.md#Disciplinary%20Action) multiple times, but still quite figure things out.\n\nAt this point, he has reason for a potential ban. The problem: when do you ban? Even bigger problem: how do members know how bans work?\n\n## Discussion\nThe most frustrating and sad thing for a member who genuinely enjoys their time with a community is to be banned from it without any prior warning. There is argument that of course Bob should have known a ban was possible, but the problem is that he will never really know unless there's a concrete agreement from the start.\n\nThis puts further emphasis on forcing users to think before they act. And while acting based on a fear of ban isn't the best motivation, it wouldn't have got to this point if they had thought beforehand. They will learn one way or another.\n\nOn creating that concrete agreement, the most straight-forward implementation of it is a 3-Strike System, though a 4-Strike System might be better.
