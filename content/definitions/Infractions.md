An **Infraction** is the official violation of a rule or community guidelines.

Infractions are used on a some bigger system to determine grounds for issuing punishments on community members (mutes, kicks, bans).

As to what *official* means will vary from community to community, but generally, if there's some [Strikes System](definitions/Strikes%20System.md), then an infraction would be when a strike is written in their database of strikes on users.

Infractions can also be *tagged* to characterize it, beyond the reason the infraction was placed. This can include some classification of its severity, how long it's effective for ([Infraction Forgiveness](discussions/Infraction%20Forgiveness.md)), involved users, etc.
