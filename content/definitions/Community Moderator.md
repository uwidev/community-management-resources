title: "Community Moderator"
---
A **Community Moderator (Moderator)** is a member of [Staff Members](definitions/Staff%20Members.md) who disciplines members who break rules or philosophies. As they are staff members, they are expected to uphold staff responsibilities.

## Responsibilities
Moderators ensures that [Members](Members) of the server adhere to its rules and philosophies. Those who take action against them face disciplinary action from moderators in the form of warns, mutes, kicks, and bans.

### Disciplinary Action
Disciplinary action is important, as in, moderators should actually *discipline* the offenders. So not only is handing the punishment a responsibility, but also teaching offenders how not to repeat said offense. To do this, the offending member needs to know the following.
1. The rule that was broken.
2. An elaboration of the rule, such that the offender fully understands.
3. The rule-breaking action, and how it broke the rule.

#### Order Matters
The order in which you present this **does** matter. 

Starting with their rule-breaking action is usually seen as an attack, that "you did wrong, therefore you are bad". Instead, you should start by finding common ground with the rules, and potentially let the user come to terms and realize that maybe they went too far.

We want to create understanding, not an argument. The moment this turns into an argument, it's learning becomes about who is right, not what is right.
