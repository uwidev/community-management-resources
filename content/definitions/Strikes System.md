A **Strikes System** is a moderation protocol of using historical infractions to determine the case of a ban. There are two mechanics to this system: what counts as an infraction, and how many infractions result to the ban.

## Determining Infractions
See [Determining Infractions](discussions/Determining%20Infractions.md).

## How Many Strikes
One may jump to a 3-strike system, similar to baseball, and that may work. Generally, you want enough strikes to give members some wiggle room to learn from their mistakes. A two strike lesson (ban on the second infraction) has only one instance of punishment and learning. And for learning, typically you need repeated exposure before things finally click.

## Forgiveness
You don't un-strike in baseball, so a strikes system doesn't have anything built-in for forgiveness. Without it, it doesn't fully capture the human perception of "badness" over time. See [Infraction Forgiveness](discussions/Infraction%20Forgiveness.md)
