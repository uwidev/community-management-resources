title: "Staff Members"
---
**Staff Members (Staff)** are members of management.

# Responsibilities
Staff are the face of the server; they act as role models and uphold the server's rules and philosophies. If they don't, many social problems can result. See [Repercussions of Non-abiding Staff](discussions/Repercussions%20of%20Non-abiding%20Staff.md).

Staff members also stand along-side [[Regulars]]. Together, these two make up the majority-tone of the server.
