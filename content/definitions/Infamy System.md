title: Infamy System

An **Infamy System** is a moderation system that aggregates an infamy value based on infraction cases to determine the case of a ban.

For a more relaxed take on determining bans, see [Strikes System](definitions/Strikes%20System.md). It loses the ability to determine severity of intraction. 

## Extending Infractions
[Infractions](definitions/Infractions.md) now have some infamy value attached to them. How this value is determined is up to the community, but is usually weighted based on the severity of the infraction. *Severity* can include things like:
- deliberateness of infraction
- server damage/annoyance
- duration of infraction instance
- repetition

## Users have Infamy
Users now have an infamy value, which is determined by the sum of all infamy from their infractions. Once this value reaches a certain point, the server is to be banned, or at the very least, highly considered for one.

## Example of an Infamy System
**(1-infamy infraction)** *Basic* cases of rule-breaking; simple corrections, and user listens to moderators. 

**(2-infamy infraction)** *Moderate* cases of rule-breaking; time-extended rule-break, and maybe some reluctance to listen and needed a mute.

**(3-infamy infraction)** *Severe* cases of rule-breaking; spamming the server due to spite or an argument, reluctance to communicate or admit any wrong-doings, deliberate rule-breaking

Once a user reaches 5 or above infamy, they are given a final warning. Any further infractions will result in a ban.

Edge case: Users at 4 infamy, and commit a severe rule-break may be banned on the spot.
