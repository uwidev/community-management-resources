**Human error is unavoiable.** [Infractions](definitions/Infractions.md) should have some way for forgiveness.

I think a lot of people can agree that all cases of wrong-doings can lie on some spectrum of forgiveness. When it comes to moderating an online community, there are infractions, and then there is forgiveness for said infractions.

For some communities, forgiveness is often overlooked and ignored. Infractions are forever. But this just isn't a good model for how humans perceive wrong-doing over time. 

If someone were to accidentally give you a fork when you asked for a spoon (the infraction), but they corrected it and consistently gave you forks afterwards, you are not going to spite that person several weeks later.

And there are obvious real cases where forgiveness isn't really possible (domestic violence), but the chances are not 0% given enough time.

## Implementing Forgiveness
How forgiveness works will vary from community to community, specially based on how they judge [what counts as an infraction](discussions/Determining%20Infractions.md). But here are some things to consider when creating a forgiveness system. 

*Italicized bullets list forgiveness ratings from easily forgiven to hardly forgiven.*
- make sure offending members knows that recovery for human error is possible
- be consistent in forgiveness
- be transparent when infractions are forgiven
- forgivenss should be largely weighted on [Classification of Rule Breaking](discussions/Classification%20of%20Rule%20Breaking.md)
	- *ignorance, misunderstandings, impulse/reckless/inconsiderate, deliberate*
- moderately weighted on the actual rule that was broken
	- *minor cases of posting content in the wrong channel, nsfw/ content in non-nsfw channel, raiding*
- weighted on importance and quantity of affected members
	- *small amount/regular members, large amount/regulars/staff*
- an infractions system with built-in forgiveness
	- e.g. ban after 3 infractions within 1 month, [[Infamy System]]
