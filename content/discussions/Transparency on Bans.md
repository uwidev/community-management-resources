title: "Transparency on Bans"

## Scenario
For this discussion, we will assume an obedient member, Bob.

Bob really likes the server, but he's dealing with personal drama that's really getting to him. He comes to the server to try to relax, but is in a rather bitter mood, and this bitterness is evident his behavior. Bob is seen as annoying and aggressive.

This is a repeated pattern of Bob for the past few days, with each case resulting in a mute. He has been [disciplined](definitions/Community%20Moderator.md#Disciplinary%20Action) multiple times, but still quite figure things out.

At this point, he has reason for a potential ban. The problem: when do you ban? Even bigger problem: how do members know how bans work?

## Discussion
The most frustrating and sad thing for a member who genuinely enjoys their time with a community is to be banned from it without any prior warning. There is argument that of course Bob should have known a ban was possible, but the problem is that he will never really know unless there's a concrete agreement from the start.

This puts further emphasis on forcing users to think before they act. And while acting based on a fear of ban isn't the best motivation, it wouldn't have got to this point if they had thought beforehand. They will learn one way or another.

On creating that concrete agreement, the most straight-forward implementation of it is a 3-Strike System, though a [4-Strike System](definitions/4-Strike%20System.md) might be better.
