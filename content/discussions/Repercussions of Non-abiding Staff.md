[Staff Members](definitions/Staff%20Members.md) that don't abide to the server's rules and philosophies create confusion among [[Members]]. Members will think that an action is okay, when in fact it is not. 

This becomes even more problematic when punishment is enforced unequally. The frustration this creates for regular members is immense, and the only "relief" is to punish said staffâ€”and that's just the start of the cascading problems.
- Members have now learned that staff does not apply their rules equally, trust is lost.
	- Whether it was due to oversight or intentional does not matter. The emotional experience of frustration and context override rightful recourse.
- Members will specifically spite that staff member.
- Staff members now have to deal with the awkwardness of disciplining past behavior.

That said, it's critical that staff abide to the server's rules and philosophies.
